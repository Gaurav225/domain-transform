Edge-aware filtering can be used as a basic building block for many image processing tasks. In this field of research the recent publication \textit{Domain Transform for Edge-Aware Image and Video Processing} ~\cite{GastalOliveira2011DomainTransform} introduces a new and promising algorithm. 

At the time of writing of this report, the only publicly avaiable implementation of this method is a Matlab version provided by the papers authors.

The goal of this project is to provide a performant C/C++ implementation of the aforementioned method, while documenting and discussing both our successfull and failed optimisation approaches.
Starting with a direct port of the Matlab code, we apply various optimisations to achieve an approximate $2$ times speedup with regard to our base version. Optimisation potential still exists as we are far from both memory and computation bounds, however neither of our further optimisation attempts get us closer to these bounds. 

\comment{
Describe in concise words what you do, why you do it (not necessarily
in this order), and the main result.  The abstract has to be
self-contained and readable for a person in the general area. You
should write the abstract last.
