\section{Optimizing Domain Transform}
We started with the matlab code provided on the homepage\footnote{\url{http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~eslgastal/DomainTransform/}} of the authors~\cite{GastalOliveira2011DomainTransform} and ported the code to C++. 
\subsection{Basic version}
In order to achieve the biggest optimisation potential the matrices have been wrapped in a simple struct (listing \ref{code:matrix_struct}).
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Matrix struct,label=code:matrix_struct]
struct Mat2
{
    uint width, height;
    float3* data; // size: width*height
};
\end{lstlisting}
In order to preserve accuracy all images are stored in a \lstinline{float3} struct. Which uses $3\times 4 = 12$ bytes per pixel. Hence a $1$M pixel image is stored in $3\times 4\times 10^6$\ B $=12$\ MB.
The algorithm starts by precomputing the differential of the image in both $x$ and $y$ directi

%\comment{
%Now comes the ``beef'' of the paper, where you explain what you
%did. Again, organize it in paragraphs with titles. As in every section
%you start with a very brief overview of the section.
%
%For this class, explain all the optimizations you performed. This mean, you first very briefly
%explain the baseline implementation, then go through locality and other optimizations, and finally SSE (every project will be slightly different of course). 
%Show or mention relevant analysis or assumptions. A few examples: 
%1) Profiling may lead you to optimize one part first; 
%2) bandwidth plus data transfer analysis may show that it is memory bound; 
%3) it may be too hard to implement the algorithm in full generality: make assumptions and state them 
%(e.g., we assume $n$ is divisible by 4; or, we consider only one type of input image); 
%4) explain how certain data accesses have poor locality. Generally, any type of analysis adds value to your work.
%
%As important as the final results is to show that you took a structured, organized approach to the optimization and that you explain why you did what you did.
%
%Mention and cite any external resources including library or other code.
%
%Good visuals or even brief code snippets to illustrate what you did are good. Pasting large amounts of code to fill the space is not good.
